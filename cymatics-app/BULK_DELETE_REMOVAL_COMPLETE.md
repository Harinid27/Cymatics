# Bulk Delete Functionality - Complete Removal

## 🎯 **ALL BULK DELETE FUNCTIONALITY REMOVED**

This document outlines the complete removal of all bulk delete functionality from the entire project as requested by the user.

## 📋 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Object-to-String Error in Location Picker - FIXED**
**Problem**: `Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {address})`

**Root Cause**: Reverse geocoding API was returning an object with an `address` property, but the code was trying to render it directly as a string.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `reverseGeocodeLocation` function to handle both string and object responses:
```typescript
let addressString = '';

if (addressResult) {
  // Handle both string and object responses
  if (typeof addressResult === 'string') {
    addressString = addressResult;
  } else if (typeof addressResult === 'object' && addressResult.address) {
    addressString = addressResult.address;
  } else if (typeof addressResult === 'object' && addressResult.data && addressResult.data.address) {
    addressString = addressResult.data.address;
  } else {
    addressString = `${coordinate.latitude.toFixed(6)}, ${coordinate.longitude.toFixed(6)}`;
  }
}
```
