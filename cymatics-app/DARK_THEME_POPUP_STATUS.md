# Dark Theme Popup Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation status of dark theme support for popups across the Cymatics app.

## Completed Changes

### Projects Screen - Delete Popup âœ“
**File:** `app/(tabs)/projects.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Added ThemedAlert Hook:** Imported and initialized `useThemedAlert` hook
2. **Replaced Standard Alert:** Converted `Alert.alert()` calls to `showAlert()` using ThemedAlert
3. **Added AlertComponent:** Added `<AlertComponent />` to the render tree

**Specific Updates:**
- **Delete Confirmation Popup:** Now uses ThemedAlert with proper dark theme support
- **Success Messages:** Project deletion success messages now themed
- **Error Messages:** Project deletion and sharing error messages now themed
- **Share Error Handling:** Share functionality errors now use themed alerts

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
const { showAlert, AlertComponent } = useThemedAlert();

// Example usage:
showAlert({
  title: 'Delete Project',
  message: `Are you sure you want to delete "${project.name}"? This action cannot be undone.`,
  buttons: [
    { text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel' },
    { text: 'Delete', style: 'destructive', onPress: deleteHandler }
  ]
});
```

## Benefits
- **Consistent Theme Experience:** Delete popups now match the app's theme (light/dark)
- **Better UX:** Dark theme users get properly styled popups instead of system defaults
- **Native Look:** ThemedAlert provides native iOS/Android alert styling with theme support

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/projects.tsx` - Main projects screen with delete functionality

## Next Steps
Other screens that may need similar updates:
- Project details screen
- Other entity delete confirmations (clients, expenses, etc.)
- Settings and profile screens
